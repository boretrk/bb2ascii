# bb2ascii
Convert Blitz Basic 2 (Amiga) source to ASCII

Blitz Basic source files (.bb or .bb2) tokenize keywords and replace newlines with nulls. This little app converts them back to ASCII.

If no output file is specified the results are dumped to the console.

Highly portable C, should work anywhere.

With thanks to Richard Dare for his work finding all the tokens (https://github.com/richardjdare/bb2-mode).
